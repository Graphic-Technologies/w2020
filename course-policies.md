{% include snippets/heading-linked.liquid text="Due dates and times" %}

Unless otherwise stated in the deliverable description or on Brightspace, deliverables must be submitted **before** the start of class on the assigned due date. **For example:** [Exercise 1: {{site.exercises[0].title}}]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.exercises[0].url}}) is due on <span class="bold content-sec-1">{{site.exercises[0].due.sec-1}}</span><span class="bold content-sec-2">{{site.exercises[0].due.sec-2}}</span> and must be submitted before the start of class at <span class="bold content-sec-1"><time datetime="08:00">8:00am</time></span><span class="bold content-sec-2"><time datetime="10:00">10:00am</time></span>

If there is ever a discrepancy between due dates or times on this site vs on Brightspace, the **due date and time on Brightspace will be used** as it automatically tracks submission times and records late submissions. If you discover any issues with due dates and times, please notify me of the issue.
