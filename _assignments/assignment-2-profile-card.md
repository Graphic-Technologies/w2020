## Introduction

For this assignment we will use the Photoshop skills learned this semester to create a double sided digital profile card. The theme and content of the card are up to you. You can make a business card, a sports card, trading card game card, or any other theme that works within the requirements below.

When planning the design and content of your card, imagine that it will be displayed on a website and will be interactive. Your card must feature a button or interactive element used to flip it over to view the other side.

## Instructions

Create a digital profile card in Photoshop. Your digital profile card will have a design for **both the front and the back** of the card, created in two side by side artboards within the same Photoshop file. Your card design must include a button or interactive element used to flip it over and view the other side. The button should be in the **same location on both the front and back** to ensure ease of usability.

### File Set Up

#### Artboards

Your file should contain two artboards using the **iPhone X/XS dimensions of 1125px X 2436px @72ppi** (portrait or landscape, your choice) for the front and back of the card

Your file should have a third artboard demonstrating the interactivity of your button. The interactivity should be demonstrated by showing your button in 3 states: **regular, hovered, and active** (on click). The size of this artboard is dependent on the size and design of your button. Your button should be displayed on this artboard at the same size as on the card.

#### Layers

Your layers should be properly labeled and well organized. Grouping and labelling your layers should be used to simplify and organize your layers. Any extra unused or hidden layers should be deleted to ensure your file is organized and to keep the file size down.

## Required Elements

Your digital profile card must include the following:

- Minimum one (1) use of Masking
- Minimum one (1) Adjustment Layer
- Minimum one (1) Layer Effect
- Minimum one (1) placed raster image\*
- Minimum one (1) placed vector graphic\*
- Minimum one (1) vector shape created in Photoshop
- Minimum one (1) point text box (heading text)
- Minimum one (1) area text box (paragraph text)
- Button used to flip card over (located in the same spot on both sides of card)

\*All placed raster images and vector graphics must be properly sourced from stock photo websites, art you have been given permission to use, or original artwork you have created. Exceptions include social media icons and brand logos when used in the same manner as in the example to list off relevant skills or experience. If you are unsure if you should be using any image or graphic, do not hesitate to contact me and forward the image and where you sourced it from and I will let you know.
