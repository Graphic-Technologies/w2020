## Introduction

This is the final assignment for the Illustrator portion of the course and will provide you an opportunity to show all of the skills you have learned so far. You will be creating a set of App Icons for an imaginary app of your creation.

## Instructions

You will create one Illustrator file containing three different versions of the same app icon.

- iPhone – 57x57 px, corner radius 10 px
  - Black and white, minimal detail
- iPad – 144x144 px, corner radius 24 px
  - Full colour, medium detail
- iTunes – 512x512 px, corner radius 90 px
  - Full colour, high level of detail

All three versions should feel unified in their design and belong in a set together. Each icon should be created on its own layer and artboard properly named as per the example below. Don't forget to also include the name of your app for reference.

### Export Your Icons

Once your icons are complete, use the `Export for Screens` dialogue to export each of icon as a **PNG** at the correct size listed above. Assuming you have sized your artboards properly to the above listed sizes, a simply 1x scale export should work perfectly. Name each export appropriately and place the export in an **Exports** folder. Review the proper folder structure in the [Submission Requirements](#submission-requirements) below for exact details.

### Examples

### Level of Detail

Your app icon should contain enough detail at the largest size to clearly show the skills you have learned this semester. However, do not go overboard with the amount of detail in your design. The level of detail should feel appropriate to the theme of your app. Take some time to look at the app icons on your devices and do some online research to get some direction for creating a modern, well designed icon.

Below are some of the basic icons from iOS 7. I have marked the icons that I would consider **not** detailed enough for this assignment with a red X.

  - **Exports** folder

## Feedback Discussion

As part of this assignment, you must submit the first draft of your icon concept, design, and color scheme to the {% include snippets/link-external.liquid link="#" text="App Icon Feedback discussion" %} to receive feedback from your peers and professor. You must also provide feedback to a minimum of two other students on their discussion posts.

This must be completed by the start of class of **Week 5** to allow time to implement the feedback received.
