## Introduction

Welcome to Adobe Photoshop, we will use Ps to create raster-based (bitmap) graphics. Our focus will be on mobile features, including designing User Interface(UI), creating/composing graphics and the necessary colour basics. Let's first get familiar with Photoshop `workspace` and then move to the basic features and tools.

## Creating Silhouettes with Masks

First, we will make and refine selections in the Selection and Masking Space to create a masking image. Let's practice along with this {% include snippets/link-external.liquid link="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/selection-masking-space.html" text="Accurately select image areas tutorial" %}.

Next, we will convert the masking image to a Smart Object Layer and change the Blending Mode of that layer to create a silhouette. To make the image more interesting, add a nice background layer. Here is a completed example.

## More Useful Tools

### Content-Aware Fill

Content-Aware Fill makes removing unwanted objects or distracting elements from your photos easy. Simply by drawing a selection around an area, Photoshop can instantly replace it with new image detail from the surrounding areas. Follow along this 5-min video, we will learn Content-aware fill workspace with the `Auto`, `Rectangular`, and `Custom` options.

### Content Aware Fill Tools

The Clone Stamp, Healing Brush and Patch tools are also content-aware fill tools. We use Spot Healing Brush to retouch unwanted dust spots, blemishes, scratches, stray hairs and other small image imperfections. In this short video, it introduces these tools to us. We will go over all other content-aware tools later in the photo retouching lesson.
