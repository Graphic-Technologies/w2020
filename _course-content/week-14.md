## Introduction

In this lesson, we will harness our Adobe XD knowledge by using Xd productivity tools, UI Kits, and plugins. We will learn the common mobile user interface elements with ease and get an introduction to the industry design standards and guidelines: Human Interface Guidelines (AppleOS) and Material Design (Android).

## Xd Productivity Tools

Let's follow this video to practice using some popular Xd features: Object Flip, Search Layers, and Linked Symbols (now components).

## Components

Xd Componenets are previousely called Symbols. This tutorial gives us an introduction of Master Components, and Component Overrides features.

### Using Components

This set of short video tutorals teaches us to create/nest/swap componenets, update master componenets and use different componenet states. We will follow along to practice. {% include snippets/link-external.liquid link="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vfz93h52t0nsgvz/Components_Demo.xd?dl=0" text="Download tutorial file" %}

{% include snippets/link-external.liquid class="btn--gradient" link="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHjwuoik-ep1PW3Dh29lgnN8X2VSBYEwt" text="Watch playlist on YouTube" %}

#### Component hover states & Micro-Interactions

Check out this video to learn how component states allows you to save elements for future use and create additional versions of your buttons, toggles, fields, and more.

## Xd Interactions

Let's watch this set of short videos to practice popular prototype interaction design in Adobe XD. We will build prototype with screen animation, transitions, drag gesture, componenet overlay, and voice control. {% include snippets/link-external.liquid link="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j12i70snyblerui/Prototyping_Demo.xd?dl=0" text="Download tutorial file" %}

### Multiple Interactions

Xd 2020 release allows desingers to apply multiple interactions to the same UI object. Follow this video to make our prototype interaction more natural.

## Content-Aware Layout

We will learn content-aware layout to quickly create and edit common design elements without a lot of tedious steps. We can also add group padding coupled with responsive resize.

For more great tutorials like this, check out {% include snippets/link-external.liquid link="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/learn/prototype.html" text="Prototype" %} on the Let's Xd website.

## Xd Ui Kits

UI Kits content contains common buttons, form elements, headers, icons, and other UI elements. Follow this XD tutorial to learn how to get UI kits and use the Kit content in your own designs.

Note: We will explorer UI Kits for {% include snippets/link-external.liquid link="https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/" text="Apple iOS" %} and {% include snippets/link-external.liquid link="https://material.io/resources" text="Material Design" %} in class to understand the platform standards together. Download {% include snippets/link-external.liquid link="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/" text="Apple iOS fonts & symbols" %} and {% include snippets/link-external.liquid link="https://material.io/design/typography/understanding-typography.html#system-fonts" text="Roboto fonts for Android devices" %}

Let's start our design with UI kits. We will follow this video to get the Wireframes UI Kits and use the content in our own XD file.

Leveraging UI Kits tutorial shows multiple ways to access UI Kits in Xd and how to download UI Kits from {% include snippets/link-external.liquid link="https://helpx.adobe.com/xd/how-to/ui-kits.html" text="Adobe Resources website" %}.

### Some Great Plugins

Let's follow this tutorial to install some useful plugins. We will only use a few these plugins for our class exercises, however feel free to try as many as you like.
