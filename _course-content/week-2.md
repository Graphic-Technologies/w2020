## The Basics

We will be using Adobe Illustrator to create vector graphics, so let's familiarize ourselves with the software.

We will start by going over this series of tutorals: [Get to know Illustrator (4 videos)](https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/illustrator/how-to/ai-basics-fundamentals.html)

- Illustrator workspace
- Zoom and Pan
- Create a new document
- Save your work

## Artboards

Artboards are like pages in your document, they are very useful to separate different elements you are designing without having to create multiple files.

Take a look at this short [Artboard tutorial. (3 videos)](https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/illustrator/how-to/artboards-basics.html)

### Work with artboards

- Understand and navigate artboards
- Create artboards
- Edit artboards

## Creating, selecting, and editing shapes

Let's learn to draw and manipulate shapes in Illustrator with this [drawing tools tutorial (5 videos)](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/drawing-tools-basics.html).

### Create with drawing tools

- Understand paths and curves
- Draw with the Pencil tool
- Draw with the Curvature tool
- Edit paths and shapes
- Join artwork together to combine paths

### Create and edit shapes

Next, we practice using the drawing tools to [create and edit shapes. (4 videos)](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/shapes-basics.html)

- Draw simple shapes
- Create lines
- Combine shapes with the Shape Builder tool
- Trace to make shapes

## Transform Options: Rotate, reflect, and shear

To streamline the process of drawing shapes and ensuring they are even, we use this set of tools to transform them and arrange them in the artboard, take a look at this video and try to follow along. The sample files are on the website you will be redirected to, make sure to download and open it before starting.

## Colour of fill and stroke

To make our designs more interesting and clear, we need to use colour. Take a look at [the first video on this tutorial page](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/color-basics.html) to learn how to apply colour to your shapes and edit the stroke as well.
