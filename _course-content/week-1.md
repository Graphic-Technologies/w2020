## Adobe Illustrator
Adobe Illustrator is a vector-based illustration program. What does that mean?
- A vector image is an image created using anchor points (or coordinates) and paths to draw shapes
- Vector images are infinitely scalable, allowing them to be rendered on a web page or printed at any size without losing quality

Adobe Illustrator is considered the industry standard for vector based illustration programs.
