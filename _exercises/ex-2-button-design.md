## Instructions

In the starter file provided, recreate the three buttons shown. Then, create a hover/alternate state for each button. To create the hover state, you can play around with the fill, stroke, opacity, or any other styling you wish. Lastly, create you own unique button and a hover state. Be creative with it! Experiment with different colours, sizes, text, and elements.
