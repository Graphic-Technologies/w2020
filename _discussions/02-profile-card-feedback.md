In this thread, post your ideas for your Digital Profile Card assignment to receive feedback from your peers. Your post should contain the following:

- Theme of your Digital Profile Card (Example: hockey player card)
- A brief description of your plan for your card (1 - 3 sentences)
- A colour pallet ([Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com) can help with that!)
- At least 3 images to help inspire your design
- A basic layout showing how your content will be displayed.

Once you have made your post, comment on **2 other posts** and provide feedback on their ideas.
